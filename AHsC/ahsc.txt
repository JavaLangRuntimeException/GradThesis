\section*{Abstract}
We present a VR demo that allows attendees to embody a non-humanoid bear avatar and directly experience how physical posture and avatar-locomotion congruence interact in shaping avatar embodiment. Prior research demonstrated that congruent avatar-locomotion conditions improve avatar identification and user experience, and that body ownership can be achieved with non-humanoid avatars through appropriate body tracking. However, the interplay between posture and locomotion congruence during active movement remains unexplored. Our demo presents a $2 \times 2$ set of posture-locomotion demo trials---two postures (standing vs. pseudo-quadrupedal) and two locomotion methods (human arm-swinging vs. avatar-congruent quadrupedal rowing)---so visitors can feel differences in embodiment, effort, and naturalness across conditions. Using a bear avatar as an illustrative case, the demo showcases how pseudo-quadrupedal posture may amplify the effects of congruent locomotion on avatar embodiment.

\section{Introduction}

Virtual Reality (VR) enables users to inhabit virtual bodies and experience the world from novel perspectives. Recent VR research has shifted its focus from visual fidelity to experiential fidelity, particularly the Sense of Body Ownership (SoBO) and Sense of Agency (SoA)~\cite{10.3389/frvir.2023.1141683}. Embodiment illusions arise when predicted motor states are congruent with incoming sensory feedback during voluntary movement~\cite{10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01125}; SoBO and SoA are functionally dissociable~\cite{10.3389/fnhum.2012.00040}, and even simple visuomotor synchrony can induce body ownership~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0010381}. Prior work further indicates that agency matters more than avatar visibility~\cite{8446229} and that comparable levels of embodiment can be achieved across different locomotion techniques~\cite{10.1109}.

Non-humanoid avatars extend embodiment beyond human-like bodies, including animals~\cite{10.1111/jcc4.12173, 10.1145/3611659.3617211}, plants~\cite{10.1038/s41598-022-05184-0}, and abstract shapes~\cite{LAN2023100020}, demonstrating the plasticity of the human body schema and even eliciting Proteus effects. However, mapping human kinematics onto non-human morphology is non-trivial~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581027, 10.1145/2485895.2485903}: full-body control of non-humanoid avatars can be fatiguing~\cite{10.1145/2380116.2380171}, and gesture-based locomotion trades increased immersion for higher physical load~\cite{10.1145/3756884.3765970}. Within this space, two factors have emerged as particularly important for non-humanoid embodiment: \textit{avatar-locomotion congruence} and \textit{physical posture}. Khan et al.~\cite{11192101} showed that locomotion methods that are congruent with the avatar (e.g., gorilla with arm-rolling, human with arm-swinging) improve avatar identification and user experience, while Krekhov et al.~\cite{8848005} demonstrated that half-body tracking can sustain body ownership for non-humanoid avatars with less strain than full-body tracking, and that body ownership correlates with game enjoyment~\cite{10.1145/3311350.3347172}.

These studies highlight avatar-locomotion congruence and physical posture as key ingredients for non-humanoid embodiment, yet they have largely been examined in isolation and mostly with users in standing posture. The interaction of these factors during active locomotion with a quadrupedal avatar therefore remains underexplored. In this demo, we investigate this interaction using a brown bear avatar and a $2 \times 2$ design that systematically varies physical posture (standing vs.\ pseudo-quadrupedal) and locomotion method (human arm-swinging vs.\ avatar-congruent quadrupedal rowing). Our research question is: \textit{Does pseudo-quadrupedal posture amplify the effects of avatar-congruent locomotion on avatar embodiment compared to standing posture during active movement?}

\section{Bear Experience}

\subsection{Avatar Selection Rationale}

We selected \textit{Ursus arctos} (brown bear) on the basis of biomechanical compatibility with human input. Bears exhibit a plantigrade gait in which the entire sole contacts the ground~\cite{10.1242/jeb.121806}, allowing intuitive hand-to-forelimb mapping. During quadrupedal locomotion, the forelimbs of the bear support 54--60\% of body weight and generate greater braking forces than the hindlimbs at all speeds~\cite{10.1242/jeb.121806}. This justifies forelimb-only control for essential quadrupedal motion patterns. Bears demonstrate 70--80 degrees of forearm pronation-supination mobility, with maximum pronation aligning with normal ground contact~\cite{amaike2021}. Human hands held palm-down directly correspond to bear ground contact posture. The shoulder height variation between subadults (approximately 60cm) and adults (90--150cm) accommodates both pseudo-quadrupedal and standing human eye heights.

\subsection{Demo Trials}

Our demo presents a $2 \times 2$ set of posture-locomotion demo trials on Meta Quest 3 that visitors can experience:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{C1 (stand-swinging):} Standing posture with human arm-swinging. Viewpoint at 1.6m (adult bear height).
\item \textbf{C2 (stand-rowing):} Standing posture with bear-like rowing locomotion.
\item \textbf{C3 (quad-swinging):} Pseudo-quadrupedal posture with (approximately 90 degree hip angle) human arm-swinging locomotion. Viewpoint at 0.7m (subadult bear height).
\item \textbf{C4 (quad-rowing):} Pseudo-quadrupedal posture with bear-like rowing locomotion.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure*}[t]

  \Description{A grid of 20 images arranged in 4 rows and 5 columns. Each row shows a different demo trial with sequential movement frames demonstrating the locomotion technique. The images show human participants performing different combinations of posture (quadrupedal vs standing) and locomotion method (rowing vs arm-swinging).}

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Locomotion Implementation}

\textbf{Human arm-swinging} adapts walk-in-place logic~\cite{10.1145/210079.210084}. The system monitors controller vertical velocity ($V_y$); when exceeding threshold ($V_{threshold} = 0.5$ m/s), forward velocity is applied:
\begin{equation}
v_{forward} = k_{swing} \cdot |V_y|
\end{equation}
where $k_{swing} = 2.0$ is the velocity conversion coefficient. This serves as a control condition---functionally effective but misaligned with bear biomechanics~\cite{10.1145/2804408.2804416}.

\textbf{Bear-like rowing} tracks controller backward velocity ($V_z$) and vertical position ($P_y$). When the controller moves backward ($V_z < -0.3$ m/s) below chest height ($H_{chest} = 0.8$ m), propulsion is generated:
\begin{equation}
v_{power} = k_{power} \cdot |V_z| \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P_y}{H_{chest}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $k_{power} = 3.0$. Lower hand positions produce greater propulsion, reflecting bear forelimb weight distribution~\cite{10.1242/jeb.121806}.

The IK system incorporates pole vector constraints. Bear forelimbs operate primarily in the sagittal plane~\cite{10.1242/jeb.140681}, unlike human shoulders which permit extensive coronal movement. The constraint computes lateral deviation:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_{pole} = \vec{v}_{elbow} - (\vec{v}_{elbow} \cdot \vec{n}_{sagittal}) \vec{n}_{sagittal}
\end{equation}
This ensures biologically plausible forelimb trajectories regardless of user arm position.

\section{Discussion}

Preliminary observations from 19 participants support our hypothesis. The majority (11/19) preferred quad-rowing (C4), reporting that posture-locomotion congruence felt more natural---aligning with Gonzalez-Franco and Lanier's~\cite{10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01125} prediction-sensory correspondence model. However, 6/19 preferred standing rowing (C3), noting that `` standing felt slower and more bear-like, suggesting that avatar movement congruence alone contributes to embodiment~\cite{10.3389/fnhum.2012.00040, 8848005}.

Pseudo-quadrupedal posture enhanced grounding sensation, possibly providing stronger physical plausibility~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3580979}, while standing reduced body ownership despite accurate viewpoint mapping. However, pseudo-quadrupedal posture induced fatigue, in congruence with findings that gesture-based locomotion providing higher presence also induces greater physical load~\cite{10.1145/3756884.3765970}, indicating the need for support mechanisms in extended experiences.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented a VR system addressing the research question of whether pseudo-quadrupedal posture amplifies congruent locomotion effects on avatar embodiment. Preliminary findings suggest an affirmative answer: participants preferred the posture-locomotion congruent condition and reported enhanced embodiment in pseudo-quadrupedal posture with congruent rowing motion. Our contribution --integrating avatar-locomotion congruence and body tracking frameworks into a $2 \times 2$ design for dynamic locomotion -- revealed that these factors likely interact rather than operate independently, extending previous static alignment research. Future work will conduct controlled experiments to quantify this interaction effect and develop support mechanisms~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3580979} that sustain postural congruence while mitigating fatigue.
