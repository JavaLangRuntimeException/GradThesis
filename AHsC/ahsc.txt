\section*{Abstract}
We present a VR system investigating interaction effects between physical posture and avatar-locomotion congruence on non-humanoid avatar embodiment. Prior research demonstrated that congruent avatar-locomotion conditions improve avatar identification and user experience, and that the Illusion of Virtual Body Ownership (IVBO) can be achieved with non-humanoid avatars through appropriate body tracking. However, the interplay between posture and locomotion congruence during active movement remains unexplored. Our system enables users to embody a bear avatar through a $2 \times 2$ design: two postures (upright vs. pseudo-quadrupedal) and two locomotion methods (human arm-swinging vs. congruent quadrupedal rowing). We hypothesize that pseudo-quadrupedal posture amplifies the effects of congruent locomotion on IVBO, providing insights for non-humanoid avatar design.

\section{Introduction}

Advances in Virtual Reality (VR) technology have enabled users to experience diverse perspectives through virtual bodies. VR research has shifted from visual fidelity to experiential fidelity---Sense of Body Ownership (SoBO) and Sense of Agency (SoA)~\cite{10.3389/frvir.2023.1141683}. These embodiment illusions emerge when users' predicted motor states match sensory feedback during voluntary movement~\cite{10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01125}. SoBO and SoA are functionally dissociable~\cite{10.3389/fnhum.2012.00040}, and visuomotor synchrony alone can induce body ownership without tactile stimulation~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0010381}.

Non-humanoid avatar embodiment has explored diverse forms including animals~\cite{10.1111/jcc4.12173, 10.1145/3611659.3617211}, plants~\cite{10.1038/s41598-022-05184-0}, and abstract shapes~\cite{LAN2023100020}, demonstrating human body schema plasticity. However, mapping human kinematics to non-human morphology presents unique challenges~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581027, 10.1145/2485895.2485903}. Two factors have emerged as critical: \textit{avatar-locomotion congruence}---matched locomotion methods that improve avatar identification~\cite{11192101}---and \textit{physical posture}---body tracking approaches (full-body vs. half-body) that enable Illusion of Virtual Body Ownership (IVBO) with non-humanoid avatars~\cite{8848005}.

This research investigates the interaction between physical posture and avatar-locomotion congruence through bear avatar locomotion.

\section{Related Work}

VR embodiment illusions arise from the match between predicted motor states and sensory input~\cite{10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01125}. SoBO and SoA are functionally dissociable~\cite{10.3389/fnhum.2012.00040}, and visuomotor synchrony alone can induce body ownership~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0010381}. Agency matters more than avatar visibility~\cite{8446229}, and comparable embodiment is achieved regardless of locomotion method~\cite{10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00070}.

Non-humanoid avatar research has explored animals~\cite{10.1111/jcc4.12173, 10.1145/3611659.3617211} and plants~\cite{10.1038/s41598-022-05184-0}, demonstrating body schema plasticity. Non-humanoid avatars also induce the Proteus effect~\cite{LAN2023100020}. However, mapping to non-human morphology is non-trivial~\cite{10.1145/2485895.2485903}, and full-body non-human avatar control causes substantial fatigue~\cite{10.1145/2380116.2380171}.

Two factors are critical for non-humanoid embodiment: avatar-locomotion congruence and physical posture. Khan et al.~\cite{11192101} showed that congruent conditions (gorilla with arm-rolling, human with arm-swinging) significantly improved avatar identification and user experience through matched locomotion methods. However, users maintained upright posture throughout---physical postural changes were not examined. Independently, Krekhov et al.~\cite{8848005} compared full-body (FB) versus half-body (HB) tracking with non-humanoid avatars (bat, tiger, spider), finding that 1:1 mapping is not a prerequisite for IVBO. FB mode for quadrupedal avatars caused substantial fatigue, while HB maintained IVBO with reduced strain. A subsequent study~\cite{10.1145/3311350.3347172} confirmed IVBO correlates with game enjoyment.

These studies independently demonstrate the importance of avatar-locomotion congruence and physical posture, but their interaction during active locomotion remains unexplored. This research integrates Khan et al.'s ``avatar-locomotion congruence'' and Krekhov et al.'s ``body tracking'' frameworks to examine whether pseudo-quadrupedal posture amplifies congruent locomotion effects on IVBO. Prior work focused on static or semi-static postural alignment; we extend this to dynamic locomotion context.

\section{Bear Experience}

\subsection{Avatar Selection Rationale}

We selected \textit{Ursus arctos} (brown bear) based on biomechanical compatibility with human input. Bears exhibit plantigrade gait where the entire sole contacts the ground~\cite{10.1242/jeb.121806}, enabling intuitive hand-to-forelimb mapping. During quadrupedal locomotion, bear forelimbs support 54--60\% of body weight and generate greater braking forces than hindlimbs across all speeds~\cite{10.1242/jeb.121806}. This justifies forelimb-only control for essential quadrupedal motion patterns. Bears demonstrate 70--80 degrees of forearm pronation-supination mobility, with maximum pronation aligning with normal ground contact~\cite{amaike2021}. Human hands held palm-down directly correspond to bear ground contact posture. The shoulder height variation between subadults (approximately 60cm) and adults (90--150cm) accommodates both pseudo-quadrupedal and upright human eye heights.

\subsection{Experimental Conditions}

Our system implements a $2 \times 2$ within-subjects design on Meta Quest 3:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{C1 (quad-rowing):} Pseudo-quadrupedal posture (forward lean, approximately 90 degree hip angle) with bear-like rowing locomotion. Viewpoint at 0.7m (subadult bear height).
\item \textbf{C2 (quad-swinging):} Pseudo-quadrupedal posture with human arm-swinging locomotion.
\item \textbf{C3 (stand-rowing):} Upright posture with bear-like rowing. Viewpoint at 1.6m (adult bear height).
\item \textbf{C4 (stand-swinging):} Upright posture with human arm-swinging.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Locomotion Implementation}

\textbf{Human arm-swinging} adapts walk-in-place logic~\cite{10.1145/210079.210084}. The system monitors controller vertical velocity ($V_y$); when exceeding threshold ($V_{threshold} = 0.5$ m/s), forward velocity is applied:
\begin{equation}
v_{forward} = k_{swing} \cdot |V_y|
\end{equation}
where $k_{swing} = 2.0$ is the velocity conversion coefficient. This serves as a control condition---functionally effective but misaligned with bear biomechanics~\cite{10.1145/2804408.2804416}.

\textbf{Bear-like rowing} tracks controller backward velocity ($V_z$) and vertical position ($P_y$). When the controller moves backward ($V_z < -0.3$ m/s) below chest height ($H_{chest} = 0.8$ m), propulsion is generated:
\begin{equation}
v_{power} = k_{power} \cdot |V_z| \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P_y}{H_{chest}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $k_{power} = 3.0$. Lower hand positions produce greater propulsion, reflecting bear forelimb weight distribution~\cite{10.1242/jeb.121806}.

The IK system incorporates pole vector constraints. Bear forelimbs operate primarily in the sagittal plane~\cite{10.1242/jeb.140681}, unlike human shoulders which permit extensive coronal movement. The constraint computes lateral deviation:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_{pole} = \vec{v}_{elbow} - (\vec{v}_{elbow} \cdot \vec{n}_{sagittal}) \vec{n}_{sagittal}
\end{equation}
This ensures biologically plausible forelimb trajectories regardless of user arm position.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented a VR system for investigating the interaction between physical posture and avatar-locomotion congruence in quadrupedal avatar embodiment. The system implements a $2 \times 2$ design combining two postures (upright vs. pseudo-quadrupedal) with two locomotion methods (incongruent arm-swinging vs. congruent quadrupedal rowing). This approach integrates Khan et al.'s~\cite{11192101} avatar-locomotion congruence framework with Krekhov et al.'s~\cite{8848005} body tracking findings for non-humanoid IVBO, extending embodiment research from static postural alignment to dynamic locomotion contexts.

Future work will conduct controlled experiments to quantify how pseudo-quadrupedal posture moderates congruent locomotion effects on IVBO, and explore support mechanisms that maintain postural congruence while reducing physical strain~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3580979}.
